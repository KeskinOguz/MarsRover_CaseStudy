# MarsRover_CaseStudy
A Case Study for develop algorithm skills. 
Main objective is this project calculate rover's last position according given position and commands.



- .NET Core 3.1 - Console App
- Clone the repo 
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/KeskinOguz/MarsRover_CaseStudy.git
  ```

## Usage and Information
  
  ### Input
  
 * number number  --> upper right coordinates of the plateau
 * number number direction --> rover starting position direction must be specify **(N,S,E,W)** letters.
 * command letters --->  **M,L,R**. **M** for move forward one grid point. **L** and **R** makes the rover spin 90 degrees<br/>
       .  <br/>
       .  <br/>
       .  <br/>
       n  <br/>
        
- Each rover has two lines of input.The first line gives the rover's position, and the second line is a series of
  instructions telling the rover how to move.
 
- You can give infinite series of commands but you must type **f** for finish commands and enter to action.
